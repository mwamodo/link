A mini personal finance system, made specifically for my needs. I doubt this will be useful to anybody else, but can be a good 
starting point if you are looking to create something similar for yourself.

- record income streams (track money in)
- record expenses (track money out)
- record spending plans & savings
- record liabilities & assets
- record and track goals (short-term 1-3 months, long-term 1-10 years)
- record and track habits
- record notes in md format
